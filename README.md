# artificial_neural_networks
This repository contains my projects on one of my courses I took in undergrad EE550 ANN. Because it was the first course I took on machine learning you may encounter some not totally correct coments in the reports. I am uploading project reports as well. In the report, comments can be found about the script parts. Here are the list of models I applied by these projects

1)Hopfield
2)Single Perceptron
3)MultiLayer Perceptron
4)Continuous Hopfield
5)Winner-take-all
